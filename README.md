# CNN_Fashion_MNIST

Fashion MNIST Image Classification
Overview
This project consists of Python scripts for building, training, and evaluating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification tasks using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Dataset
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset serves as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.

Project Structure
data_preprocessing.py: This script preprocesses raw image data from the Fashion MNIST dataset stored in a folder. It converts images into NumPy arrays, performs one-hot encoding for labels, and saves the processed data into an NPZ file.
cnn_model.py: This script defines the architecture of the CNN model using Keras. The model is built with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for image classification.
train_and_test.py: This script handles the training and testing of the CNN model. It loads the preprocessed data, trains the model on the training set, evaluates its performance on the test set, and visualizes the results.
Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

Download the Fashion MNIST Dataset:
